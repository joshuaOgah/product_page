# Frontend Mentor Project
Live Demo: https://joshuaogah.github.io/product_page/

This project is a solution to a challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Overview
This was built to practice my front-end skills (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) using a real-world design which was provided by Frontend Mentor.
This was built with only desktop screens in mind so it's not mobile responsive.

## What I Learned
- I got to practice my css positioning and layout skills
- I used JavaScript to make the page dynamic
